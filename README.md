# SNA

This repository contains a series of notebooks and datasets relating to my ongoing research into the social networks of Biblical law. The datatypes required for the SNA are participant data (=nodes) and verbs/agency (=edges). The creation and analysis of these datatypes are located elsewhere:

* Participant data: https://github.com/ch-jensen/participants
* Verbs and semantic roles (agency): https://github.com/ch-jensen/semantic-roles
